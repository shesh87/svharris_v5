Sheonna Von Harris's Portfolio Website Redesign

I am recreating my portfolio website in under ONE WEEK!
The website should hit these marks:

1. Showcase my best and latest designs from print, web and mobile projects.
2. Be responsive and mobile ready. It does not have to be "mobile first" but mobile needs to be seriously designed for.
3. Represent my minimal, straight lines, white space design style.
4. Clear, concise navigation.
5. Not take more than a week including updating and inputting the content.
